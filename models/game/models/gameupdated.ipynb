      "\n",
      "* **Use the Pomodoro Technique:** Work in focused 25-minute intervals, followed by a 5-minute break.  After four Pomodoros, take a longer break (15-20 minutes). This structured approach prevents burnout and maintains focus.  Even if you pull an all-nighter (Option 0),  this method will make it significantly more productive and less overwhelming.\n",

      "Instead of venting and procrastinating, the individual should immediately implement a structured approach:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Prioritize and Break Down the Task:**  Instead of feeling overwhelmed by the entire presentation, the person should break it down into smaller, manageable chunks.  This could involve creating a detailed outline (as option 3 suggested), defining specific sections (introduction, body points, conclusion), and allocating a realistic timeframe for completing each section.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Timeboxing:** Allocate specific time blocks for working on each section of the presentation.  This creates a structured approach and prevents feeling overwhelmed by the sheer volume of work.  Even small blocks of focused work (e.g., 30-minute intervals with short breaks) are more effective than long periods of avoidance.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Pomodoro Technique:**  This is a specific time management technique that involves working in 25-minute intervals followed by a 5-minute break.  After four \"pomodoros,\" take a longer break (15-20 minutes).  This structured approach can boost focus and productivity.\n",

      "By implementing these time management and task breakdown techniques, the individual can transform the overwhelming feeling of a massive task into a series of manageable steps, significantly reducing stress and increasing the likelihood of completing the presentation successfully.

      "Okay, I understand you chose to immediately start working on the presentation, even if it means staying up all night.  While this demonstrates a proactive approach,  pulling an all-nighter is rarely a sustainable or effective solution for managing stress and completing high-quality work.  Let's create a recovery plan to address both the immediate crisis and prevent this from happening again.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Immediate Actions (Tonight):**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Time Management (Modified Option 0):**  Instead of just diving in, break the next few hours into focused work sprints.  Set a timer for 50 minutes of intense work followed by a 10-minute break. During breaks, get up, stretch, walk around, or do something completely unrelated to the presentation to refresh your mind.  Prioritize the most crucial elements of the presentation first. Aim for progress, not perfection in this initial phase.  The goal isn't to finish everything tonight, but to make significant headway and reduce the overwhelming feeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Prioritize Sleep (Crucial):**  Even if you don’t finish, aim for at least 4 hours of sleep.  Sleep deprivation exacerbates stress and impairs cognitive function, making tomorrow's presentation even harder.  Consider a sleep aid like melatonin if you struggle to fall asleep, but consult a doctor or pharmacist first.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Mindfulness Exercise (5-10 minutes):** Before bed, practice some deep breathing exercises or a short guided meditation.  Apps like Calm or Headspace can be helpful. This will help calm your racing mind and prepare you for sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Tomorrow's Actions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Finish the Presentation (Early):** Continue working on the presentation first thing in the morning.  Stick to the same work sprint strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Healthy Lifestyle Choices:** Focus on nourishing your body. Eat nutritious meals and stay hydrated. Avoid excessive caffeine or sugar, as these can exacerbate stress and anxiety.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Presentation Rehearsal:** Do a full run-through of your presentation aloud. This helps you identify any weak points and smooth out your delivery.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Self-Compassion:**  Be kind to yourself.  You made a choice to tackle the problem directly, even if the execution wasn't perfect. Acknowledge your efforts and learn from this experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Post-Presentation Review:** After the presentation, take some time to reflect on what went well and what could be improved for next time.  Celebrate your accomplishment!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Long-Term Strategies (Preventing Future Stress):**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Time Management Techniques:** Learn and implement effective time management strategies like the Pomodoro Technique (as you started tonight) or time blocking. This will help you avoid last-minute cramming.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Procrastination Management:** Identify your procrastination triggers and develop coping mechanisms.  This might involve breaking down large tasks into smaller, less daunting steps, setting realistic deadlines, or seeking accountability from a friend or mentor.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Stress Management Techniques:** Explore various stress-reduction techniques such as exercise, yoga, meditation, or spending time in nature. Find what works best for you and incorporate it into your routine.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Seek Professional Help:**  If you frequently experience overwhelming stress or anxiety, consider seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor.  They can provide you with personalized strategies and support.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This recovery plan focuses on a balanced approach. While immediate action is necessary, long-term strategies are essential to prevent future episodes of overwhelming stress.

      "Okay, so you chose to watch a movie to de-stress before tackling your presentation. While short-term relaxation can be helpful, relying solely on this method when facing a significant deadline like yours isn't the most effective long-term strategy.  Let's create a plan to address both your immediate stress and the underlying procrastination.  The goal is to manage your stress levels while also ensuring you deliver a successful presentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Understanding the Choice:**  Choosing the movie demonstrates a need for immediate stress reduction.  It's a common coping mechanism, but it can backfire if it leads to further procrastination and increased anxiety later.  We need to address that underlying avoidance behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recovery Plan:**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Phase 1: Immediate Stress Reduction (Next 30 minutes):**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Mindful Breathing Exercise (5 minutes):**  Find a quiet space. Sit comfortably, close your eyes, and focus on your breath. Inhale deeply through your nose, hold for a few seconds, and exhale slowly through your mouth. Repeat this 10 times, noticing the sensation of your breath entering and leaving your body.  This will help calm your nervous system.\n",
      "* **Short, Engaging Activity (15 minutes):**  Instead of a full movie, choose a short, engaging activity that doesn't require deep concentration.  This could be listening to upbeat music, a short walk outdoors, or even a quick tidy-up of your workspace. The goal is to shift your focus away from the overwhelming thought of the presentation without completely disconnecting from the task at hand.\n",
      "* **Gentle Stretching or Light Exercise (10 minutes):** Physical activity releases endorphins, which have mood-boosting effects.  A few simple stretches or a brisk walk will help to release tension and improve focus.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Phase 2: Task Breakdown and Planning (Next 60-90 minutes):**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Detailed Outline (30 minutes):**  Now, it's time to face the presentation head-on, but in a manageable way.  Forget about creating the perfect slides immediately. Instead, focus on creating a detailed outline. Break down your presentation into its core components (introduction, body points, conclusion). List the key points you want to cover under each section.\n",
      "* **Prioritization (15 minutes):** Review your outline and prioritize the most crucial points.  Which sections are essential for conveying your message? Focus your initial efforts on these key areas.\n",
      "* **Resource Gathering (15-30 minutes):**  Gather all the necessary research materials, data, and visuals you'll need. This reduces the time spent searching later, making the actual writing process more efficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Phase 3: Focused Work Blocks (Rest of the Evening):**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Pomodoro Technique:** Work in focused bursts of 25 minutes, followed by a 5-minute break. This technique helps maintain concentration and prevents burnout.\n",
      "* **Realistic Goals:** Don’t aim for perfection in one sitting. Focus on completing specific sections of your outline, even if it's just one slide at a time.\n",
      "* **Avoid Perfectionism:**  Remember, your goal is to deliver a solid presentation, not a masterpiece.  Focus on clarity and conveying your key message effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Phase 4: Self-Compassion and Sleep:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Acknowledge your feelings:**  It's okay to feel stressed and overwhelmed.  Be kind to yourself and acknowledge that procrastination is a common issue.\n",
      "* **Prioritize sleep:** Aim for at least 6-7 hours of sleep. A well-rested mind is crucial for effective work and managing stress.  Even if you have to pull an all-nighter *partly*, prioritize sleep as much as possible.\n",

      "Okay, I understand you chose to immediately start working on the presentation, even if it means pulling an all-nighter.  While this demonstrates a proactive approach,  let's acknowledge that this isn't sustainable in the long run and likely contributed to a significant increase in your stress levels.  We need to address both the immediate crisis and the underlying issues that led to this situation.  Here’s a recovery plan:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Immediate Action (Tonight):**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Prioritize & Chunk:** Even though you're starting late, resist the urge to just dive in randomly.  Spend the *first* 30 minutes creating a *very* basic structure.  Focus on the main points you absolutely *must* cover. Don't worry about perfecting slides or wording – just get the core argument down.  Then break it into smaller, manageable chunks (e.g., introduction, 3 main points, conclusion).  Tackle one chunk at a time.  Set realistic time goals for each chunk, rather than aiming for perfection immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Time Management:** Use the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes work, 5 minutes break).  This structured approach can help you maintain focus and prevent burnout.  During breaks, step away from your computer – get some water, stretch, or do some quick light exercises.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Limit Caffeine & Sugar:**  While tempting to stay awake with caffeine and sugary snacks, they’ll lead to a crash later, exacerbating your stress. Opt for water and healthy snacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Get Some Sleep (even if it's limited):** Aim for at least 4-5 hours of sleep.  Sleep deprivation will severely impair your performance tomorrow.  Even a short period of rest is better than none.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Post-Presentation (Tomorrow & Beyond):**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Self-Compassion:** Be kind to yourself.  You handled a stressful situation.  Acknowledge that you pulled through, even if it wasn’t ideal.  Avoid self-criticism; learn from this experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Debrief & Analyze:** After the presentation, take some time to reflect on what worked well and what could be improved. This is crucial for future presentations. Did your rushed approach affect the quality? What could you have done differently to avoid this last-minute scramble?\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Long-Term Procrastination Strategies:**  The root cause of this stress was procrastination.  Let's address that.  Consider these strategies:\n",
      "\n",
      "    * **Time Blocking:** Schedule specific times for tasks in your calendar, treating them like appointments you can't miss.\n",
      "    * **Breaking Down Tasks:** Consistently break down large tasks into smaller, manageable steps.  This makes them less daunting.\n",
      "    * **The Two-Minute Rule:** If a task takes less than two minutes, do it immediately.  This prevents small tasks from piling up.\n",
      "    * **Reward System:**  Reward yourself for completing tasks. This positive reinforcement can help motivate you.\n",
      "    * **Identify Underlying Issues:**  Sometimes procrastination stems from deeper issues like fear of failure or perfectionism.  Consider journaling or talking to a therapist to explore these.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Stress Management Techniques:**  Implement regular stress-reducing activities into your routine:\n",
      "\n",
      "    * **Exercise:** Regular physical activity is a powerful stress reliever.\n",
      "    * **Mindfulness/Meditation:**  Even 10 minutes a day can make a significant difference.\n",
      "    * **Deep Breathing Exercises:**  Practice these throughout the day to calm your nervous system.\n",
      "    * **Healthy Diet & Sleep Hygiene:** Prioritize regular sleep and a balanced diet.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a comprehensive approach. It's okay to not implement everything at once. Prioritize what feels most manageable and build from there.  Remember,  seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. If you find yourself consistently struggling with procrastination or stress management, consider seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor. They can provide personalized strategies and support to help you develop healthier coping mechanisms.\n",

      "* **Detailed Outline (30 minutes):**  Now, let's tackle that outline.  Break the presentation down into its core components: Introduction, Body (with clearly defined sections), Conclusion, and Q&A.  Within each section, list the key points you need to cover. Don't worry about perfect wording yet; focus on structure.\n",
      "* **Prioritize & Time-Block (30 minutes):** Look at your outline and assign estimated time to each section.  Be realistic!  It’s better to slightly overestimate than underestimate.  Schedule specific blocks of time for each section, including short breaks in between. This creates a manageable plan and reduces the feeling of being overwhelmed.\n",
      "* **Gather Resources (15 minutes):** Identify the specific resources you'll need (articles, data, images) for each section.  Gather them now; having them readily available will save you time later.\n",
      "* **Mini-Reward (15 minutes):** After completing these tasks, allow yourself a small, healthy reward. This could be a short walk, listening to your favorite song, or a healthy snack.  This reinforces positive behavior and prevents burnout.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Phase 2: Focused Work (Next 4-6 Hours)**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Time-Blocked Work Sessions:** Stick to your schedule as closely as possible.  Work on one section at a time.  If you find yourself getting distracted or overwhelmed, take a 5-minute break to stretch, walk, or do another breathing exercise.  The Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes work, 5 minutes break) can be helpful.\n",
      "* **Avoid Perfectionism:** Your goal tonight isn't perfection; it's completion of a solid, presentable presentation. Aim for \"good enough\" for now. You can refine it later if you have time.\n",
      "* **Hydration & Nutrition:**  Drink plenty of water and eat healthy snacks throughout the night. Avoid excessive caffeine or sugar, as they can exacerbate anxiety.\n",

      "**Phase 3: Post-Work & Sleep (Remaining Time)**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Review & Edit:** Once you've completed the main body, take some time to review and edit for clarity and flow.\n",
      "* **Prepare Visual Aids:** If you're using slides, spend some time on those now.  Keep them concise and visually appealing.\n",
      "* **Practice (Optional):** If time allows, practice your presentation out loud. This will build confidence and help identify any areas that need improvement.\n",
      "* **Wind-Down Routine:** An hour before bed, engage in relaxing activities like reading a book, listening to calming music, or taking a warm bath.  Avoid screens during this time.  Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep.\n",

While a short break can be helpful to reset, relying solely on this approach at a stress level of 60/100 with a looming deadline isn't the most effective strategy.  Let's create a recovery plan that incorporates both stress reduction and productive action.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Understanding the Choice:**  Choosing the movie suggests you're feeling overwhelmed and are employing avoidance as a coping mechanism.  This is understandable given the pressure, but avoidance often exacerbates anxiety in the long run.  The hope for spontaneous inspiration is unlikely at this stage.\n",

      "**Recovery Plan:**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Phase 1: Immediate Stress Reduction (Next 30-60 minutes):**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Mindful Movie Watching (with caveats):**  Instead of passively watching a movie, choose something light and calming, perhaps a comedy or nature documentary.  Actively focus on the present moment – the visuals, sounds, and emotions evoked.  Avoid anything intense or anxiety-inducing.\n",
      "* **Mindfulness Exercise (10 minutes):**  After 30 minutes of the movie, take a 10-minute break to practice a mindfulness technique. This could be deep breathing exercises, a guided meditation (plenty are available on apps like Calm or Headspace), or simply focusing on your senses (what you see, hear, feel, smell, taste).  This will help ground you in the present and reduce the racing thoughts.\n",

Break down the presentation into manageable chunks (e.g., introduction, main points 1, 2, 3, conclusion).  For each chunk, list the key information and evidence you need.  Don't worry about perfect wording yet, just focus on structure.\n",
      "* **Information Gathering (60 minutes):**  Based on your outline, start gathering the necessary information. This could involve reviewing notes, conducting research, or consulting relevant materials.  Set a timer to avoid getting bogged down in any one area.\n",
      "* **Short Break (15 minutes):**  Take a short break to stretch, walk around, or listen to some calming music.  This prevents burnout.\n",

      "* **Review & Edit (30 minutes):**  Once you have a complete first draft, take a break and then review and edit your work.\n",
      "* **Prioritize Sleep (7-8 hours):**  Even if you haven't finished everything, get a good night's sleep. A well-rested mind is far more effective than a sleep-deprived one.  Finish any remaining work early tomorrow morning if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Perfectionism:** Let go of the need for perfection. A good presentation is clear, concise, and well-organized, not necessarily flawlessly polished.\n",
      "* **Self-Compassion:** Be kind to yourself.  It’s okay to have procrastinated; the important thing is to take action now.\n",
      "* **Future Planning:** After this presentation, reflect on your work habits and develop strategies to avoid similar situations in the future.  Consider time management techniques like the Pomodoro Technique or breaking large tasks into smaller ones.\n",

      "📊 Difficulty: EASY\n",
      "\n",
      "📜 Scenario: You're feeling quite neutral today – not particularly happy or sad, just...blah.  You're sitting at home, scrolling through social media, and notice a friend posted a picture of them having a fantastic time at a concert. You feel… nothing.  A slight shrug, perhaps. How do you best respond to this feeling of neutrality and potentially engage with your emotions?\n",
      "\n",
      "💡 Choices:\n",
      "   0. Ignore it and keep scrolling.  Neutrality is fine; there's nothing to address. \n",
      " ✓ 1. Engage in a relaxing activity like reading a book or listening to music to distract yourself from the feeling. (CORRECT)\n",
      "   2. Force yourself to feel something – try to conjure up feelings of excitement or happiness to counteract the neutrality. \n",
      "   3. Immediately call your friend and express your envy of their fun night out. \n",
      "\n",
      "🤖 AI Chose: 1. Engage in a relaxing activity like reading a book or listening to music to distract yourself from the feeling.\n",
      "✅ Correct: Yes\n",
      "💡 Explanation: This is a healthy way to address neutrality.  Sometimes, gentle self-soothing activities can help you notice and acknowledge a lack of strong feelings, allowing you to gently shift towards a more positive emotional state. It's a proactive approach to well-being.\n",
